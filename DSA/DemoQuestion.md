**Question:**

Write a C program that implements **Sorting Algorithm**.

1. Implement **Any Sorting** to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
2. After sorting, implement **Searching Algorithm** to find a user-specified number in the sorted array.
3. The program should:
   * Take input for the number of elements in the array.
   * Accept user input for the array elements.
   * Sort the array .
   * Prompt the user to enter a number to search.
   * Use  Searching to check if the number is present and display its position (or indicate if not found).

**Constraints:**

* Takes input for the number of elements
* Accepts user input for the array elements
* Sorts the array using **Bubble Sort**
* Prompts the user to enter a number to search
* Uses **Binary Search** to find the number and display its position

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Enter number of elements: 5  
Enter elements: 9 3 7 1 5  
Sorted array: 1 3 5 7 9  
Enter number to search: 7  
Element found at index: 3  
```
